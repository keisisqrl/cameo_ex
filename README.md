# CameoEx

*Cameo: a hybrid cultivar of "golden" apples*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/keisisqrl/cameo_ex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/keisisqrl/cameo_ex)

IRC gateway for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)

This is in the "just getting started" phase. IRC server code is hopefully
reasonably idiomatic. Discord client hasn't been written yet, but will use the
[discord_ex](https://hex.pm/packages/discord_ex) package.

## IRC <-> Discord semantic translation

This is likely to be the hard part. It will need to be configurable to some
extent, probably through interaction with a service-analogue.
